    <p>Video games aren't bad for you. They're actually making your life better. Despite hand-wringing over a supposed connection between violence and video games (hint: there isn't any), numerous academic studies indicate that playing video games has many psychological and even physical benefits. Gaming can be very fun espically fornite because you can play with friends and have a good time.</p>
