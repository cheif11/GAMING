    <p>It's hard to get enough active play and exercise if you're always inside playing video games. And without enough exercise, kids can become overweight. Really overdoing video games also could affect other important stuff, like friendships and how well a kid does in school. And kids who play violent video games might act more aggressively. If you play for too long it can cause strain on the eyes and be bad for you in the future, in other words causing you long term problems.</p>
